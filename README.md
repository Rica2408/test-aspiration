# Intrusctions

First you need to add the file .env and add the constant **REACT_APP_API** and add your KEY of git hub
 then you can run **npm start** to run the project

## Example

REACT_APP_API = ghp_uEjvim4OQKqlpNmrXMcjokavdnIDSf06DIAj

# Improvements

## Code Structuring:

I think that i can improve the structure of the code with some libraries like eslint or using typescript, we need to create the types of each function, constant and components.

## Refactoring:

We could add a file that have the mean function that we use to use.
Using High order components.

## Additional features:

I could add more queries and information when i click in any topic, I would reduce the first query, that I use have all de information of topics and related topic, I would delete the button of search and I would add the function of search button when the user stop to write in the input.

I would add other that test more components and functions
